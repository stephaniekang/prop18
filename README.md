# CA Proposition 18: Youth Voting

## About
This project aims to use publicly sourced data to examine how passing CA Proposition 18, or the Primary Voting for 17-Year-Olds Amendment, can impact youth voting behavior, including voter registration and turnout. The youth population is an increasingly important group of eligible voters and encouraging them to vote can have a significant effect on election outcomes. We examine how Prop 18 may influence youth voting by making comparisons between states that have passed a similar legislation (i.e. allow 17-year-olds to vote in primaries) and those that have not (such as California).

## Definitions and Data Sources
The data used for this project were primarily collected from the Tufts University Center for Information Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), [Youth Voting and Civic Engagement in America](https://circle.tufts.edu/explore-our-data/youth-voting-and-civic-engagement-america) and the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/).

### Tufts University data
The Youth Voting and Civic Engagement dataset includes "more than 30 measures and information about youth voting across multiple elections" and "provides a more comprehensive perspective on young peopleâ€™s civic engagement in America." The webpage includes a description of the key elements and the data sources used. Here, we define and describe the variables used for our analysis. All data are for election years 2016 and 2018, and sourced from Tufts CIRCLE unless otherwise noted.

* **vote_cast**: Estimated number of votes in the election cast by young people, ages 18-29.
* **register**: Estimated percentage of young citizens, ages 18-29, registered to vote in the election.
* **turnout**: Estimated percentage of young citizens, ages 18-29, who cast a ballot in the election.
* **youth_pop**: Number of United States citizens between the ages of 18-24.
* **elect_law_score**: A score, from 1 to 10 that measures how strongly a state has implemented laws that facilitate registration and voting, such as pre-registration and automatic registration (see [Facilitative Election Laws](https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/facilitative-election-laws)).
* **hs_register**: Is there a state statute focused on facilitating the voter registration of high school students?
* **party**: Political party of partisan lean.
* **leaning**: The partisan lean of the electorate in the past two presidential elections (party and leaning were split into two separate variables from the original, refer to cleaning script [here](https://github.com/stephaniekang/prop18/tree/master/data-challenge/02-clean-data).
* **primary_17**: Are 17 year-olds allowed to vote in the primaries if they will be 18 by the time of the general election? Data sourced from [National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL)](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primaries-voting-age.aspx#Resources) and [FairVote](https://www.fairvote.org/primary_voting_at_age_17#facts_17_year_old_primary_voting).

### Data collection
The CIRCLE provides an interactive data tool that allows users to easily explore the data. A limitation of the tool is that national-level data (i.e. comparing all states) only allows users to look at one variable at a time. This limits cross-state comparisons on multiple variables, which we are interested in given that some states allow 17 year-olds to vote in primary elections, while others do not. Data was collected by selecting variables of interest and downloading the individual CSV files.

### U.S. Census data
The U.S. Census Bureau contains data on voting and registration found [here](https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/voting/data.html). Voting and registration data are available from 1960 to 2018. Data include information on voter registration, voter turnout, and the U.S. population by different groups such as age, race, sex, education level, etc. 

### Data collection
For this project, we collected data by downloading Excel files provided by the data tables [here](https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/voting/data/tables.2018.html). We chose to focus on state-level data by age group in order to make comparisons between states that allow 17 year old primary voting and those that do not (including California).

## Repository Structure
The repository is composed of five main folders inside the master folder, `data-challenge`:

1. [01-raw-data](https://github.com/stephaniekang/prop18/tree/master/data-challenge/01-raw-data): contains the raw data collected from Tufts CIRCLE and the US Census Bureau
2. [02-clean-data](https://github.com/stephaniekang/prop18/tree/master/data-challenge/02-clean-data): includes the R script for cleaning the raw data and the clean data file in .csv format
3. [03-visual](https://github.com/stephaniekang/prop18/tree/master/data-challenge/03-visual): contains the R scripts to create the data visuals
4. [04-output](https://github.com/stephaniekang/prop18/tree/master/data-challenge/04-output): contains the actual data visualization files (HTML)
5. [05-presentation](https://github.com/stephaniekang/prop18/tree/master/data-challenge/05-presentation): includes the presentation for the virtual showcase and all materials (images, etc.) used to make the presentation

**Note:** Users can download the master folder to their local drive and run the `R` scripts and only need to change the working directory file path, if necessary. The current default is set to Desktop.
